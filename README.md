# sudoku
I like to play Sudoku on my phone, but the amount of ads that free apps have, just bothers me..
So basically, I decided to create my own Sudoku and meanwhile implement some technologies that I donâ€™t know!
For the moment, this will be a web app taking into consideration mobile devices. Maybe in the future, I'll create a mobile app :)
